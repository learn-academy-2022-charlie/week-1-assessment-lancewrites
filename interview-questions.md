# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is the version control software. Github stores the information from git in a cloud with user-friendly GUI (graphic user interface).

  Researched answer: Git (Global Information Tracker) is a version control software that allows multiple people to share and work on the same code base. The versions of code are uploading into a git repository on GitHub.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Equality operators and relational operators return Boolean values of true or false.

  Researched answer: Equality, relational, and logical operators return Boolean values. Equality operators determine if values are equal. Relational operators determine how values relate to each other--greater than, less than etc. Logical operators (and, or, not) determine the truth of a statement.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a positional address of an element inside an array. A value is the significance of an element; for example, 3 has a value of 3, but a string with the number 3 in it ("3") would not have a value of 3.

  Researched answer: In an array, the content of each element is called the value. The index is the location of the content of each value in the array. An element listed first in an array will have its own value but its index will be 0 because arrays are zero indexed.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration elicits a specified behavior until a certain condition is met, then the behavior stops. If no ending condition is properly specified, the behavior will be executed infinitely, or until something breaks.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the performance of repetitive tasks, such as cycling through an array. An iteration is a single instance of a specified repeated behavior.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming has a driver and a navigator. The driver is the one who types in the code that the navigator dictates. The navigator types no code, instead, they do research to determine the best code for the driver to write.

  Researched answer: The driver takes a cognitive break while they code at the instruction of the navigator. The navigator assumes responsibility of carrying the cognitive burden while the driver focuses on typing correctly. Having two sets of eyes on the same code helps to find mistakes. Also having another person to whom one is accountable keeps them from being as distracted as they might be if they were alone.
